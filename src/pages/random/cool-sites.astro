      <span>All of these sites caught my eye or interested me in one way or another: either design, content or both.</span>
      <span>However, I do not endorse any of these sites or their authors.</span>

      <CoolSite name="nft price floor" href="https://nftpricefloor.com" img="v1700368775/m19y.dev/cool-sites/nftpricefloorcom_rl0wz9.webp">
        <p>I don't know where I came across this site but I love the neo-brutalist design. One of the first I saw that used it.</p>
        <p>Previous version <a class="underline" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/shoveltoss-com/image/upload/v1653013442/m19y.dev/cool-sites/nftpricefloorcom_wgjt2s.webp">screenshot</a>.</p>

      <CoolSite name="tiny projects" href="https://tinyprojects.dev" img="v1653013442/m19y.dev/cool-sites/tinyprojectsdev_r1c8wq.webp">
        <p>I found this developer / site on HN. It seems he's gone quiet but I thought his project was cool while it lasted.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="increment" href="https://increment.com" img="v1653013442/m19y.dev/cool-sites/incrementcom_ieofhi.webp">
        <p>I love the design of this site and the magazines. I always wanted to purchase them but I've lost interest since then...</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="teenage engineering" href="https://teenage.engineering" img="v1653013442/m19y.dev/cool-sites/teenageengineering_uoe6c6.webp">
        <p>This website is very fitting for the products it's built to sell; incredibly unique and beautiful to look at.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="awful library books" href="https://awfullibrarybooks.wordpress.com" img="v1700368426/m19y.dev/cool-sites/awfullibrarybookscom_kiqg3v.webp">
        <p>I listed this site for later reading more than anything; the concept seems pretty funny.</p>
        <p>It looks like the authors have decided to move on for now (unfortunately).</p>
        <span>This site has since been <a class="underline" href="https://awfullibrarybooks.wordpress.com/2023/08/10/not-goodbye-but-see-ya-later/">archived</a>.</span>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="maya land" href="https://maya.land" img="v1654046000/m19y.dev/cool-sites/mayaland_jahqgp.webp">
        <p>Super cool design. A mix of low-fi, simple static site and artfulness. They seem to have a lot of content for later reading as well.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="based cooking" href="https://based.cooking" img="v1654046206/m19y.dev/cool-sites/basedcooking_wadtiq.webp">
        <p>I loved the idea of this site since it was first announced by LS. I haven't tried any of the recipes but it's a great alternative to awful recipe sites.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="uses.tech" href="https://uses.tech" img="v1654653869/m19y.dev/cool-sites/usestech_acu5pg.webp">
        <p>I love the concept and execution is pretty good. I wish there was an easier way to determine when a site was added.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite name="ritual dust" href="https://ritualdust.com" img="v1700370069/m19y.dev/cool-sites/ritualdustcom_rsmviy.webp">
