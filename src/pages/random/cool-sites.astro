      <span>Last updated: 03/07/2024</span>
      <span>All of these sites caught my eye or interested me in one way or another: either design, content or both.</span>
      <span>However, I do not endorse any of these sites or their authors.</span>
      <span>‚≠ê === personal favorite</span>

      <CoolSite site={sites['nft-price-floor']}>
        <p>I don't know where I came across this site but I love the neo-brutalist design. One of the first I saw that used it.</p>
        <p>Previous version <a class="underline" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/shoveltoss-com/image/upload/v1653013442/m19y.dev/cool-sites/nftpricefloorcom_wgjt2s.webp">screenshot</a>.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['tiny-projects']} inactive>
        <p>I found this developer / site on HN. It seems he's gone quiet but I thought his project was cool while it lasted.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['increment']} archived>
        <p>I love the design of this site and the magazines. I always wanted to purchase them but I've lost interest since then...</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['teenage-engineering']}>
        <p>This website is very fitting for the products it's built to sell; incredibly unique and beautiful to look at.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['awful-library-books']} archived>
        <p>I listed this site for later reading more than anything; the concept seems pretty funny.</p>
        <p>It looks like the authors have decided to move on for now (unfortunately).</p>
        <span>This site has since been <a class="underline" href="https://awfullibrarybooks.wordpress.com/2023/08/10/not-goodbye-but-see-ya-later/">archived</a>.</span>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['maya-land']}>
        <p>Super cool design. A mix of low-fi, simple static site and artfulness. They seem to have a lot of content for later reading as well.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['based-cooking']}>
        <p>I loved the idea of this site since it was first announced by LS. I haven't tried any of the recipes but it's a great alternative to awful recipe sites.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['uses-tech']}>
        <p>I love the concept and execution is pretty good. I wish there was an easier way to determine when a site was added.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['ritual-dust']}>
        <p>I know nothing about the author or the history the site but I love it's design. I really need to take a deep dive into it one day.</p>
        <p>Previous version <a class="underline" href="v1654654403/m19y.dev/cool-sites/ritualdustcom_f0nmhz.webp">screenshot</a>.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['low-tech-magazine']}>
        <p>Very cool concept and content. I've learned I'm a sucker for dithering.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['standard-ebooks']}>
        <p>I like the site design but I love the mission more.</p>
      </CoolSite>

      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['the-metal-archives']} star>
        <p>Probably in my top 5 favorite websites of all-time. It's an invaluable resource as a metal fan and it's just a fantastically maintained project.</p>
      </CoolSite>
      <CoolSite site={sites['astronomy-picture-of-the-day']}>
