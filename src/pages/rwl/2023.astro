      <h2>albums</h2>
      <p>I really jumped back into listening to music this year. I sort of stopped caring about keeping up and/or delving into old albums around 2020.</p>
      <p>I was stuck in a loop of podcasts while occasionally checking out a new album or revisiting an old favorite.</p>
      <div class="title-link">
        <b>Rotting Christ</b> - <i class="love">Thy Mighty Contract (1993)</i>

        &ensp; <p>I'm still working through the classics of all the metal subgenres and I finally got around to this one.</p>
        <p>By the name I honestly thought I would be another Norwegianesque blastfest but I was so pleasently surprised.</p>
        <p>This album was such a nice transition from my journey into NWOBHM and thrash, back to bm. They perfectly mix groove, melody, and thrashing with black metal vox and blast beats.</p>
        <p>This quickly became on of my top 10 bm albums.</p>

        &ensp; <p>After finally checking out TMC, I had to check out other classic Hellenic albums.</p>
        <p>This album is a fantastic companion to TMC and I've heard members of RC play on this one (the riff on Lustful Father was a dead giveaway).</p>
        <p>Just as fantastic as TMC and could overtake TMC as one of my favorites with more spins.</p>

      &ensp; <p>I wanted to chronicle this one so I can revisit in the future.</p>
      <p>I'm rating as meh as it doesn't stick with me but I didn't hate what I heard.</p>
      <p>Quickly reading about them I see this term "estatic black metal" and "joyful" descriptors.</p>
      <p>Not sure how I feel about the gimmick but I want to keep up with them. I'm sure they're despised in the trad bm scene similar to Deafheaven and other "hipster bm".</p>
      <p>Their logo rules though lol.</p>

      &ensp; <p>Wow. This album man. I hopped on the shoegaze bandwagon in the early 2010's when numerous hardcore bands started aping the style.</p>
      <p>Most of the classics did nothing for me as I was still accustomed to breakdowns and blast beats. Hum were really the only band that stuck out.</p>
      <p>During the summer I decided to delve into some classics again and with a focus on "bands that inspired Nothing" and Catherine Wheel was on the top of that list.</p>
      <p>From track 1 I was hooked. There's plenty of heaviness that I don't hear in a lot of other Brit bands from that era, which I love.</p>
      <p>The only miss on the album for me if I Want To Touch You, a single off Ferment. It has the classic jangly Brit pop-rock sounds that I absolutely despise.</p>
      <p>Luckily that song is an outlier and the rest of the album is a divine mix of heavy, ethereal and overall super catchy rock.</p>
      <p>Highly recommend. Also listen to Nothing :)</p>

      &ensp; <p>I need more time with this one but I like what I heard. It's lofi without sounding like shit. The aethestics are great as well.</p>

    <p class="text-lg">A whole lot of Doom</p>
    <p>One day I decided to listen to the entire Black Sabbath discography; I had never listened to full BS album prior. I don't remember the original motivation but I'm glad I did.</p>
    <p>I always associated Sabbath with dad/butt rock since it was mixed in with Puddle of Mudd and Seether on the radio.</p>
    <p>As I eventually migrated to metal from hardcore I always skipped over Doom and never thought to really check out Sabbath.</p>
    <p>Sabbath is incredible. The amount of hits on the first two albums is insane and the later albums are obviously major inspiration on not only modern doom but all metal.</p>
    <p>I honestly couldn't believe that those original Sabbath albums were released in the early 70's.</p>

      &ensp; <p>Sabbath was my entry point into the Doom rabbit hole. What I found were some incredible albums that I regret not looking into earlier.</p>
      <p>In the future I'd like to analyze these albums more in depth.</p>

    <p>All of these bands / albums are amazing in their own right and all owe at least part of their sounds to Sabbath.</p>
